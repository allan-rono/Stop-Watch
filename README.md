# Stop-Watch
Author: Allan Rono

# Basics
The stopwatch works by pressing the start button when the event begins. For example, if you were timing a race, you would press the start button when the race starts. When the race is over, press the stop button. The time of the race displays on the stopwatch just as the time of day would display on your wristwatch. Clear the watch when you are done so that is is ready for the next event you want to time. Most stopwatches do not attach to a personâ€™s wrist--the person wears it around his neck or carries it in his pocket.
